//In this code snippet, you're performing floating-point division using 4.0 / 0. In Java, dividing a non-zero number by zero using floating-point division results in a special value called "Infinity." So, the value of the var variable will be assigned Infinity. This operation doesn't throw an exception because floating-point arithmetic is designed to handle this case, and the result is a valid mathematical concept
//class Program7 {

// In the code snippets you've provided, the difference in behavior between the two cases is due to the type of division being performed (floating-point division vs. integer division).

// Let's go through each code snippet to understand why one produces an exception and the other doesn't:

// Copy code

//     public static void main(String[] args) {
//             double var = 4.0 / 0;
//                     System.out.println(var);
//                         }
//                         }
//                         In this code snippet, you're performing floating-point division using 4.0 / 0. In Java, dividing a non-zero number by zero using floating-point division results in a special value called "Infinity." So, the value of the var variable will be assigned Infinity.

// In this code snippet, you're attempting to perform integer division using 4 / 0. In Java and most programming languages, integer division by zero is not defined and will result in an ArithmeticException being thrown. Integer division doesn't have a concept of "Infinity" like floating-point division does, and dividing by zero is considered an error
